# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Podoromo

https://roadmap.sh/projects/pomodoro-timer








The goal of this project is to learn and practice frontend development skills by building a Pomodoro Timer, a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.


Requirements





You will create a Pomodoro Timer web application using the frontend framework of your choice e.g. React, Vue or Angular. Here is the list of requirements for the application:





    User should be able to start stop and resume a pomodoro timer.


    User should be able to configure the default interval configuration; default work session should be 25 minutes, short break should be 5 minutes and longer break after 4 work sessions should be 15 minutes.


    Application should display the current session type (e.g., Work, Short Break, Long Break).


    It should also track the number of tracked work sessions


    Play a sound when a session ends to notify the user.


    Ensure the app is accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.





You can use any existing pomodoro apps for the UI inspiration e.g.





    time.fyi - Pomodoro Timer


    Pomofocus - Pomodoro Tracker





Technical Requirements





    Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a frontend framework/library such as React, Vue, or Angular).


    Implement state management for the timer and session tracking.


    Use a modular and reusable code structure.


    Maintain proper accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).





Feel free to deploy the application on GitHub Pages, Vercel or Cloudflare pages





By completing this project, you will enhance your frontend development skills while building a functional and customizable Pomodoro Timer application. This knowledge will prepare you for more advanced projects and improve your ability to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
